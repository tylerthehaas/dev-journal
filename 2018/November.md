## impressions from align-web readme

```
> * All interactive elements should be given an ID QA can use for automation.
> > * Format `__test__{component-name}--{descriptive-name}` i.e `__test__save-cancel-header--primary-button`
```

* Would it be better to do this as data attributes?
  * Advantages:
    * more explicit as to what it is for
    * doesn't require multiple id's if you need an id for your implementation
    * It's inline with what the community is following based on what facebook has done with react natives testID prop
  * Disadvantages:
    * requires a change in convention on the team
    * requires more indepth knowledge on working with css selectors though this has a low learning curve


* Can we start using lodash-loader to decrease bundle size from pulling in all of lodash?

* Love that enums are preferred to string literals

* Discriminated Union
  * There is some code that makes use of these especially when creating 
  * for explanation of how this works see: [Discriminated Unions]("https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#discriminated-unions")

## [Git Tagging](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/inspecting-a-repository/git-tag)

for a wip tag do: `git tag wip`

## updating translations

`en_us` is treated as the master file. If a translation is in en_us and not the others it will add it (with the english text), and vice verse - if there is a translation in the others that isnâ€™t in en_us it will remove it

That happens in the `alphabetize-json.js` file, it runs with the `yarn prettier` script

to sync everything up just run `npm run alpha:translations` (this script is also included in `npm run prettier` script)

## How promises are handled in redux store

redux-promise-middleware is used to dispatch pending, fulfilled and rejected versions when it receives a message that has a promise in its payload. [redux-promise-middleware](https://docs.psb.codes/redux-promise-middleware/)

## Removing v0/one-on-ones/:oooid/goals

we need to just remove the call to `v0/one-on-ones/:oooid/goals` in order to do so we I have to trace where the attachedContent prop in AttachedSection component is getting its data from. 

currently calling `getGoalsAttachedToOneOnOne` which then dispatches an action to set goals based on their type when the call is fulfilled.
I can try to replace the call to  `one-on-ones/:oooid/goals` with `v1/one-on-ones/:id` within the `getGoalsAttachedToOneOnOne` fn. then I could pass `data.agendaContent` to the `transformGoals` fn. I would just need to figure out how align is getting agendaContent.type currently. I will look into that tomorrow.

## Removing v0/one-on-ones/:oooid/goals continued

This endpoint was not used in the rendering of any part of the UI. I was able to remove that and all referenced redux actions safely.

## Deleting remote git tags

`git tag -d [tagname]`

## Calendar Web: Calendar tab and Calendar Settings

### Location of tests for proper routing

It doesn't look like there is anything currently testing that routing is done correctly when a link is clicked. But it seems to make sense that this should be done in component test files.

### Testing that navigation works

1. create store with call to createStore passing to it the reducer from our store.
2. use the Provider component from react-redux and set the store prop to the store created in step 1.
3. Create history with a call to createMemoryHistory from the history library and pass an an object with a key of initialEntries set to a value of an array containing initialEntry strings.
4. Call the Router component from react-router as a child to the Provider component and pass your history to its history prop.
5. Call your apps base component as a child to Router.
6. make any assertions you need.

When your done it should look something like this

```
  it('renders the calendar component when I navigate to those pages', () => {
    const store = createStore(reducer);
    const history = createMemoryHistory({ initialEntries: ['/'] });
    const { getByTestId, queryByTestId, getByText } = render(
      <Provider store={store}>
        <Router history={history}>
          <App {...appProps} />
        </Router>
      </Provider>,
    );
    expect(getByTestId('home')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(queryByTestId('calendar')).not.toBeInTheDocument();
    fireEvent.click(getByText(/calendar/i));
    expect(queryByTestId('home')).not.toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(getByTestId('calendar')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
```

This doesn't quite work though because I am rendering just the app. where the app renders it like this....

```
  <Provider store={store}>
    <ThemeProvider theme={cssVariables}>
      <Router history={history}>{routes}</Router>
    </ThemeProvider>
  </Provider>,
```

If I mirror that it should fix my problem.
