in the ca-envision api I was able to run the tests by calling `node
./node_modules/.bin/startup start -P 5000` however when I run the tests they
are all failing due to a `Error: spawn gm ENOENT`. This occurs before making
any changes in the repo.I will need to figure out what is required to get these
tests to pass.

I was able to fix `Error: spawn gm ENOENT` by
[following this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19252318) This brought up a
credentials error from the aws-sdk package about not having set the right
credentials.

I was able to fix the credentials issue by
[following this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33175424). The next error was
`AllAccessDisabled: All access to this object has been disabled`.
